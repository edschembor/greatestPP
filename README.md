A C++ unit testing library based on the Greatest C library: https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest

To use, just #include greatestpp.h in your project - but don't because its not yet completed

Contributing
============

Before contributing, please first view the original "Greatest" project for which this repo is based on: https://github.com/silentbicycle/greatest

Currently, the goal is to transfer code from greatest to greatestpp, but of course with basic c++ syntax changes, etc. The next steps will be adding c++-specific check, etc
